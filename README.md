# Hello World Starter

> A hands-on learning resource for building universal React applications with Tamagui, Next.js, Expo, and a Laravel backend.

ðŸ“š Read the full [Learning Guide](LEARNING_GUIDE.md) for detailed setup, tutorials, and best practices.

## Overview

Hello World Starter is an educational monorepo showcasing how to build an "Authenticated Notes Wall" application across Web and Mobile platforms. It emphasizes:

- Universal UI using Tamagui
- Web application with Next.js
- Mobile application with Expo (React Native)
- Type-safe APIs and schemas with TypeScript and a Laravel backend
- Theming, authentication, and state management

## Key Technologies

- Next.js (Web)
- Expo (Mobile)
- Tamagui (UI & Theming)
- TypeScript & Solito
- Laravel (API Backend)
- TanStack Query (Data fetching)
- Zustand (State management)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development workspace (Web & API)
yarn dev

# In a separate terminal, serve the Laravel API
cd apps/laravel-api && php artisan serve

# To start the Expo mobile client
cd apps/expo-mobile && yarn start
```

### Accessing API Documentation

Once the Laravel API is running (via `php artisan serve`, typically on `http://localhost:8000`), you can access the interactive API documentation generated by Scramble in your browser at:

[http://localhost:8000/docs/api](http://localhost:8000/docs/api)

For full instructions and advanced configurations, see the [Learning Guide](LEARNING_GUIDE.md).

## Project Structure

- apps/next-web Next.js web application
- apps/expo-mobile Expo mobile application
- apps/laravel-api Laravel API backend
- packages/ Shared packages (ui, config, shared, features, etc.)

## ðŸš€ Tutorial: Exploring the Starter

This brief tutorial will guide you through running the project and understanding its key parts.

**1. Run the Core Apps:**
Follow the instructions in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section to install dependencies and run both the Next.js web application (`yarn dev` in root, or `cd apps/next-web && yarn dev`) and the Laravel API backend (`cd apps/laravel-api && php artisan serve`).

**2. Explore the Web Application:**
Open your browser to the Next.js app (usually `http://localhost:3000`). Try out the features:

- View the public notes list on the homepage.
- Register a new user account.
- Log in with your new account.
- Access the protected notes page and add a new note.
- Log out.

**3. Check the API Documentation:**
With the Laravel API still running, visit the interactive API documentation in your browser:
[http://localhost:8000/docs/api](http://localhost:8000/docs/api)
This documentation, generated by Scramble, shows all available API endpoints, their parameters, and expected responses. It's a great way to understand the backend contract.

**4. Dive into the Code Structure:**
Take a look at the project layout:

- `apps/`: Contains the runnable applications (Next.js, Expo, Laravel).
- `packages/`: Contains shared code used across applications.
  - `api-types`: Defines TypeScript types and Zod schemas (manual and generated) for API interactions. Contains custom-built scripts (`generate-api-types.js`, `post-process-schemas.js`, and `check-endpoints.js`) that we created specifically to solve the API synchronization challenge - these are not part of any external package.
  - `shared`: Includes the primary `apiClient` for frontend-backend communication.
  - `features/auth` & `features/notes`: Contain the core logic and hooks for authentication and notes features.
  - `ui`: Holds reusable Tamagui UI components.
  - `brand`: Defines the color palettes and themes.
  - `config`: Central Tamagui configuration.

**5. Learn More:**
This was just a quick tour! For detailed explanations of the architecture, code structure, specific features, and development workflows, please refer to the comprehensive [**Learning Guide (LEARNING_GUIDE.md)**](LEARNING_GUIDE.md).
