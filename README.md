# Hello World Starter

> A hands-on learning resource for building universal React applications with Tamagui, Next.js, Expo, and a Laravel backend.

ðŸ“š Read the full [Learning Guide](LEARNING_GUIDE.md) for detailed setup, tutorials, and best practices.

## Overview

Hello World Starter is an educational monorepo showcasing how to build an "Authenticated Notes Wall" application across Web and Mobile platforms. It emphasizes:

- Universal UI using Tamagui
- Web application with Next.js
- Mobile application with Expo (React Native)
- Type-safe APIs and schemas with TypeScript and a Laravel backend
- Theming, authentication, and state management

## Key Technologies

- Next.js (Web)
- Expo (Mobile)
- Tamagui (UI & Theming)
- TypeScript & Solito
- Laravel (API Backend)
- TanStack Query (Data fetching)
- Zustand (State management)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development workspace (Web & API)
yarn dev

# In a separate terminal, serve the Laravel API
cd apps/laravel-api && php artisan serve

# To start the Expo mobile client
cd apps/expo-mobile && yarn start
```

### Laravel API: First-Time Setup

Before you can run `php artisan serve` for the Laravel API for the first time, or if you've freshly cloned the repository, you'll need to perform these one-time setup steps. These commands should be run from within the `apps/laravel-api` directory:

1.  **Navigate to the API directory (if you are in the monorepo root):**

    ```bash
    cd apps/laravel-api
    ```

2.  **Install PHP Dependencies:**
    (This step might be covered if `composer install` is part of a root-level `yarn install` script for the `laravel-api` workspace. If not, or to ensure dependencies are current):

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment:**

    - Create your local environment configuration file:
      ```bash
      cp .env.example .env
      ```
      _(If `.env.example` does not exist in `apps/laravel-api`, you will need to create the `.env` file manually and populate it with the necessary Laravel environment variables, particularly for database connection.)_
    - Open the `.env` file (e.g., `apps/laravel-api/.env`) and update your database connection details (`DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`).
    - **Crucial:** Ensure the database specified in `DB_DATABASE` (e.g., `my_notes_app_db`) has been created on your database server (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) _before_ running migrations. For SQLite, the database file will typically be created automatically in the `database` directory.

4.  **Generate Application Key:**
    Laravel requires an application key for encryption and other security features.

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    This is the command that sets up your database schema by creating all the tables.

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

6.  **(Optional) Seed the Database:**
    If the project includes database seeders to populate your tables with initial or dummy data:
    ```bash
    php artisan db:seed
    ```

After completing these steps, your Laravel API backend will have its database configured and schema in place. You can then run it using `php artisan serve` as shown in the main Quick Start.

### Accessing API Documentation

Once the Laravel API is running (via `php artisan serve`, typically on `http://localhost:8000`), you can access the interactive API documentation generated by Scramble in your browser at:

[http://localhost:8000/docs/api](http://localhost:8000/docs/api)

For full instructions and advanced configurations, see the [Learning Guide](LEARNING_GUIDE.md).

## Project Structure

- apps/next-web Next.js web application
- apps/expo-mobile Expo mobile application
- apps/laravel-api Laravel API backend
- packages/ Shared packages (ui, config, shared, features, etc.)

## ðŸš€ Tutorial: Exploring the Starter

This brief tutorial will guide you through running the project and understanding its key parts.

**1. Run the Core Apps:**
Follow the instructions in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section to install dependencies and run both the Next.js web application (`yarn dev` in root, or `cd apps/next-web && yarn dev`) and the Laravel API backend (`cd apps/laravel-api && php artisan serve`).

**2. Explore the Web Application:**
Open your browser to the Next.js app (usually `http://localhost:3000`). Try out the features:

- View the public notes list on the homepage.
- Register a new user account.
- Log in with your new account.
- Access the protected notes page and add a new note.
- Log out.

**3. Check the API Documentation:**
With the Laravel API still running, visit the interactive API documentation in your browser:
[http://localhost:8000/docs/api](http://localhost:8000/docs/api)
This documentation, generated by Scramble, shows all available API endpoints, their parameters, and expected responses. It's a great way to understand the backend contract.

**4. Dive into the Code Structure:**
Take a look at the project layout:

- `apps/`: Contains the runnable applications (Next.js, Expo, Laravel).
- `packages/`: Contains shared code used across applications.
  - `api-types`: Defines TypeScript types and Zod schemas (manual and generated) for API interactions. Contains custom-built scripts (`generate-api-types.js`, `post-process-schemas.js`, and `check-endpoints.js`) that we created specifically to solve the API synchronization challenge - these are not part of any external package.
  - `shared`: Includes the primary `apiClient` for frontend-backend communication.
  - `features/auth` & `features/notes`: Contain the core logic and hooks for authentication and notes features.
  - `ui`: Holds reusable Tamagui UI components.
  - `brand`: Defines the color palettes and themes.
  - `config`: Central Tamagui configuration.
